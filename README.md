# Algorithms and Data Structures  
  
## Overview  
This repository is dedicated to exploring, implementing, and understanding various **algorithms** and **data structures**. It serves as a resource for learning, practicing, and referencing fundamental concepts in computer science.  
  
## Project Structure  
  
### Files  
- **`.gitignore`**    
  Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git. This ensures that unnecessary or sensitive files are not tracked in version control.
  
- **`README.md`**  
  Provides an overview of the repository, including its purpose, structure, and how to use it. You're reading it now!  
  
### Folders  
- **`algorithms/`**    
  Contains implementations of various algorithms, categorized by type (e.g., sorting, searching, graph, dynamic programming).  
  
- **`data-structures/`**  
  Contains implementations of various data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, graphs, and more.
